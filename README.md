simple live coding
===============

This is a proof of concept for a live drawing app in Ruby with
the [Ruby-Processing Gem (based on processing-2.0.1, and jruby-1.7.4)](https://github.com/monkstone/ruby-processing)

Get inspired by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) or join the project with your own idea..

This drawing was made from a 6 year old girl at the CoderDojo cologne...

There is a stand alone app to play with without need of installing all stuff.
With "ellipse 50 50 80 80" or "rect/line/fill" you can draw and with mouse dragging change the values.
